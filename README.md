## Steps to quick-start
I would ask all of you to setup development environment in your notebooks. This would allows us to quickly learn and start designing apps in the workshop. Following guide will help you in the installation.

* Install 
  * [Git] (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  * [Java] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
  * Option 1: Needs quite a space ~1.5GB on your notebook. Make sure you have this space available.
    * [Android Studio] (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
    (This will take a while to setup)
  * Option 2: If you already have eclipse.
    * [Eclipse + ADT] (https://developer.android.com/studio/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html)

### Troubleshooting
  * Java : 
    [Environment Path] (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html)
  * Android Studio : 
    if it is very slow, try re-configuring the memory allocation at ` $ANDROIDSTUDIOHOME/bin/studio.exe.vmoptions `, e.g.,:

     ```
      -Xms512m
      -Xmx1024m
      ```
  * Eclipse : 
    if it is very slow, try re-configuring the memory allocation at `$ECLIPSEHOME/eclipse.ini`, e.g.,:

      ```
      -Xms512m
      -Xmx1024m
      ```
